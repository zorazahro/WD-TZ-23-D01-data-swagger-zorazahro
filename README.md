**Instructions**:

- Create a form as shown in the reference images below. The form should have four fields total:

  - First name
  - Last name
  - Email
  - Message

- Each Input field should have its `type` attribute and it's corresponding `label` tag specified.
- The input fields with the type of "text" should have a `hotpink` outline on focus.
- The input field with the type "email" should have a `blue` outline on focus. Same for the "textarea" field.
- Make sure to select the inputs by type when styling for focus.
- The form should also have a checkbox which is styled as a toggle switch.
- At the end of the form, there should be an input for submit. This input field should be `disabled`.
